		<p>My name is Kylie (or “Ky”, either works) Wojciechowski, and, to answer your question, the trick to pronouncing my last name is to say “Where’s your house key?” quickly.</p>

		<p>Now that that’s out of the way: <strong>I’m a user experience researcher and designer &amp; technical communicator.</strong> My other interests include accessibility, information architecture, content strategy, and microcopy.</p>


		<p>I’m best at identifying patterns and distilling complex data into clear, actionable content.</p>


		<p>I’m in the second semester of my first year in the Master of Science in Information program at the University of Michigan’s <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">School of Information</a>, specializing in User Experience (UX) Research &amp; Design.</p>

		<p>I’m currently working as a UX Research Intern in the University of Michigan’s Office of Enrollment Management, supporting the implementation of the Slate CRM tool.</p>

		<p>I’m also serving as an Instructional Designer with the University of Michigan Library as part of the Engagement Fellowship Program, developing and testing instructional modules on topics in library research methodologies.</p>

		<p>I graduated magna cum laude from <a href="http://www.svsu.edu/rhetoricandprofessionalwriting/">Saginaw Valley State University</a> (SVSU) in May 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Professional &amp; Technical Writing. I also studied philosophy.</p>

		<p>When I wasn’t in class, I served as a junior researcher with SVSU’s Center for Usability Studies &amp; Universal Design, as a senior mentor at SVSU’s Writing Center, as web editor and editor-in-chief of my campus newspaper, and as an information management co-op at The Dow Chemical Company. (I transitioned to that role full-time immediately following graduation.)</p>

		<p>I’m passionate about researching and working toward system usability and accessibility, and I value clarity and honesty—not only in my work, but in all aspects of my life, too.</p>

		<p>In terms of the unofficial, off-the-record Kylie, I’m pretty simple. I read and travel and listen to podcasts. In the summer, I longboard. Other than that, I spend most of my time with my friends and family and the dogs my family got to replace me when I left for college.</p>
